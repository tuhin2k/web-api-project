# How To Run It ?

you need to install pm2 module globally in node js  , and build-essential on linux   

```bash
    sudo apt install build-essential
```

```bash
    npm install pm2 -g
```

now , clone our github repository.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sumon2017/web-api-project.git
```


open up a terminal in ***web-api-project/onoff***  

now , from **onoff** directory give excecute permission to our scripts  

```bash
    chmod 777 ./on.sh
    chmod 777 ./off.sh
```

now from **onoff** directory to start the program run :

```bash
    ./on.sh
```

cautious : you have to be in **onoff** directory

this will take between 10-15 minutes depending on your hardware and internet speed  

this will create 3 node js servers  (you can see them by [pm2 list]  command )  
At the end of it , success will be printed  


To stop it  , run :  

```bash
    ./off.sh
```

# NoSql Cloud Database
All servers are connected to their own mongodb cloud databases . So , when testing there should be internet connection . We gave all server secrets and mongodb uri in .env files , So it will work fine .
